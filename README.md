# üêô quirk

Quirk is a crossplatform, GPL-licensed, [Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy#Declining_effectiveness) 
app built in React Native / Expo. 

Unlike many CBT apps, it's fairly unbiased in what you use it for; it doesn't ask about your mood or ask you 
to depression-specific CBT exercises. That makes it fairly quick and discreet to use, especially in a public 
setting.

## Running Locally

Quirk is built on React Native and therefore assumes you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. 
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) is preferred over NPM as a package manager.

```sh
# clone the project and cd into it
git clone git@github.com:Flaque/quirk.git; cd ./quirk

# install dependencies
yarn

# start development environment 
yarn start
```

You'll then be in the [expo development environment](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/). 
If you already have XCode installed with a simulator, you can just press `i` to start it.

# Design

Quirk's goal is to be both inviting and focused. It should be _really_ easy to enter in a thought; people frequently enter these in public settings and need to do it fairly quickly. It also should not cause any increased frustration. 

## Color Palette
To bootstrap this, we're just using [a pre-canned, but fairly muted, color palette.](https://flatuicolors.com/palette/ru)

## Other Stupid Design Logic
I'm not really a designer, but I do like to engage in _stupid design logic_ for why things are a certain way. Quirk has
a particlar style, but it's one I ripped off from a bunch of other apps. 

Some things are muted because they're dumb and not the important bits. But the important bits are big, gigantic works of in-your-face crunchy juicy goodness. Titles should be bold, the boldyest bold you got. Only got one thing to say? Make [that thing a full screen giant, towering over mortals.](https://i.imgur.com/zcplBkP.png)

Illustrations should be excessively cute and burst with as much personality as your artistic talent can muster. None of that sleek silicon valley business casual airplane art. Nah. **Give me bubbles and smiles.** We're making a healthy-cool app here, not some collared-shirt wearing fintech money market manstravaganza. 

Though the UI design tweeks I stole from a lot of other apps, this general thinking comes from [the game design concept of "Juice."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=216_5nu4aVQ)

# License

## Does that mean I can publish and redistribute my own version?

As long as you publicly share the up-to-date code, you can yes. Though I would ask that you change the name and branding 
to avoid conflicts and confusions among less tech-savy customers.
